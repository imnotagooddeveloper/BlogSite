    <h1>Read me if you want add pages</h1>
    <p>Take this file or page as default if you want add a new page</p>
    <p>So every page or psot is loaded like its a html page itself</p>
    <p>BUT! all posts will use css inside "index.html"</p>
    <p>and about images.</p>
    <p>Uhh idk why but you can go 1 folder up like "../images/image.png" or you can just make "/images/image.png" both of them works</p>
    <p>you know what "Bests" say? if it works dont touch it. So I wont either!</p>
    <p>you can add things like <img src=""> directly inside code dont worry it'll work</p>
